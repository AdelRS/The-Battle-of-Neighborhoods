    "Undoubtedly, setting up a restaurant has great attractions. Properly managed and with a good public relations policy, it can become a new option in the local leisure scene. Today more than ever, the profession of chef is especially valued and, if our skills are mainly culinary, we can aspire, why not, to the star. From an economic point of view, in the most successful cases a return of 25% has been achieved - it is more normal to expect a return of between 15% and 20%.\n",

    "It is crucial to be aware of current trends in gastronomy. Healthy and sustainable eating, creating awareness of food waste, using customer-focused technology and offering unique and personalized experiences are some of them.\n",
    "It is also necessary to make a very sincere internal analysis, to know what we can do with the resources we have (economic, technical, human, etc.). A good previous study and the knowledge of our target audience, will allow us to define in the most concrete way possible our business concept, its structure, positioning, location and elements of the marketing mix.\n",
